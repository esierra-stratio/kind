== Cloud provider objects

=== EKS

In a *default deployment*, the following objects are created in AWS (you can see in [silver]#gray# optional objects that will depend on what is specified in the cluster descriptor):

* [silver]#1 VPC.#
* [silver]#6 subnets with their respective routing tables.#
** [silver]#3 public subnets (one per AZ).#
** [silver]#3 private subnets (also one per AZ).#
* [silver]#1 NAT gateway for each public subnet.#
* [silver]#1 Internet gateway for the VPC.#
* [silver]#1 default route in the routing table of each private subnet to go out to the Internet through the NAT gateways.#
* [silver]#1 default route in the routing table of each public subnet to exit the internet through the internet gateway.#
* 1 IAM policy for the nodes of the cluster (_nodes.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io_).
* 1 IAM role for cluster nodes (_nodes.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.k8s.io_).
* 1 Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with add-ons for EBS and CNI, logging (if specified) and an OIDC provider.
** 2 EKS Security Groups for the control-plane and the worker nodes.
** 1 IAM role with AmazonEKSClusterPolicy.
* VMs for _Workers_ (according to cluster descriptor and auto-scaling).
** 1 EBS volume per persistent volume.
* 1 _Network_ type load balancer for service exposure.
** 1 _Listener_ per port for each _Service_ type load balancer.
* EBS volume for each persistent volume.

=== GCP

* 1 SSL/TCP load balancer for the API Server.
* 1 Health check for the _Unmanage Instance Group_.
* 1 CloudNat VPC partner.
* 1 Cloud Router.
* Firewall rules.
* 1 _Unmanage Instance Group_ for the _control-plane_.
* 1/3 VMs for the _control-plane_ (according to the cluster descriptor).
** 1 EBS Volume per VM.
* VMs for workers (according to the cluster descriptor and auto-scaling).
** 1 EBS volume per VM.
* 1 L4 load balancer for service exposure.
** 1 _Listener_ per port for each service of load balancer type.
* EBS volume for each persistent volume.

== Security

=== IMDS access in EKS

Since pods running on an AWS node can impersonate the node where they run by simply interacting with IMDS, a global network policy (Calico's _GlobalNetworkPolicy_) is used to prevent access to all pods in the cluster.

In turn, the EKS OIDC provider is enabled to allow the use of IAM roles for _Service Accounts_, ensuring the use of the IAM policies with minimal privileges.

=== Access to the API Server endpoint

==== EKS

During the creation of the EKS cluster, an endpoint is created for the API Server. This endpoint is used to access the cluster from the installer and lifecycle operations.

This endpoint is also published on the internet, and its access is restricted with a combination of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) rules, and Kubernetes' native RBAC (Role Based Access Control).

==== GCP

For API Server exposure, a load balancer is created with the name `<cluster_id>-apiserver`. It has port 443 accessible by the public network (the assigned public IP is the same as configured in the _Kubeconfig_) and one _instance group_ per AZ (1 or 3, depending on HA configuration) with the corresponding _control-plane_ node.

The _Health Check_ of the service is done via SSL, but it is recommended to change to HTTPS with the `/healthz` path.

== Storage

=== Nodes

Regarding storage, a single root disk is mounted and its type, size and encryption can be defined.

Example:

[source,bash]
----
type: gcp2
size: 384Gi
encrypted: true
----

These disks are created in the initial provisioning of the worker nodes, so this data is passed as descriptor parameters.

=== _StorageClass_

By default, the cluster provides a _StorageClass_ ("gp2" in AWS and "csi-gcp-pd" in GCP) for a block disk with _filesystem ext4_. This _StorageClass_ is created with `reclaimPolicy: Delete` and `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, i.e. the disk will be created at the moment a pod consumes the corresponding _PersistentVolumeClaim_, and deleted when the _PersistentVolume_ is deleted.

It should be noted that the _PersistentVolumes_ created from this _StorageClass_ will have affinity to the area where they have been consumed.
