= Installation

== Prerequisites

=== EKS

* Roles and policies
+
For automated provisioning in EKS, it is necessary to execute actions on various AWS services such as ec2, ecr, eks, elasticloadbalancing, etc. While the use or lack of use of these actions will depend on the type of installation, the provider validates that the indicated user has these permissions in order to run normally.
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-eks-policy.json [Download permanent permissions for EKS].
** xref:attachment$stratio-eks-temp-policy.json[Download temporary permissions for EKS].

* Certified operating systems

To ensure the functionalities supported by the EKS-managed _control-plane_, you should use any AMI provided by AWS specifically for this purpose.

The https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html[AMIs optimized for Amazon EKS] are built on the Amazon Linux 2 operating system.

=== GCP

* Permissions

For deployments on the Google Cloud Platform, you will require permissions on _compute_ (instances, disks, images, routers, networks, etc.). Similarly to other supported providers, provisioning requires an account with all requested permissions.
+
xref:attachment$stratio-gcp-permissions.list[Download permissions for GCP].

* Certified operating systems
+
For GCP environments, use https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/tree/master/images/capi[_image builder_], an official tool to create and distribute images for _Stratio KEOS_.
+
The currently recommended operating system for this provider is Ubuntu 22.04.

== Proprietary infrastructure

Although one of the advantages of automatic resource creation in provisioning is the great dynamism it provides, for security and compliance reasons, it is often necessary to create certain resources prior to the deployment of _Stratio KEOS_ in the cloud provider.

As it will be shown below, the provider supports the use of both a VPC and subnets previously created using the networks parameter in the cluster descriptor.

== Descriptor of the cluster

To indicate the specifics of the cluster, the _KeosCluster_ object is used in a manifest file.

The header of this descriptor will be the same as for any Kubernetes object:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: installer.stratio.com/v1beta1
kind: KeosCluster
spec:
----

=== _spec_

The _spec_ of the _KeosCluster_ is composed of the following fields:

[cols="1,4,2,1"]

=== Credentials

On the first execution, the credentials for provisioning in the cloud provider will be indicated in this section.

These secrets are encrypted with a passphrase requested from within the provisioning in the _secrets.yml_ file, thus removing the entire credentials section of the descriptor.

In subsequent executions, the passphrase is simply requested to decrypt the secrets file, from which the credentials are read.

The following fields are considered provisioning secrets:

[cols="1,4,2,1"]
|===
^|Name ^|Description ^|Example ^|Optional

|aws
|Credentials for AWS access.
|See <<descriptor_example, Descriptor example>>.
|Not when infra$$$_$$$provider=aws.

|gcp
|Credentials for GCP access.
|see <<descriptor_example, Descriptor example>>.
|Not when infra$$$_$$$provider=gcp.

|github$$_$$token
|GitHub token. You can use a _Fine-grained token_ or a _classic_ type token, and you don't need any permissions. To generate it, go to: 'Settings' → 'Developer settings' → 'Personal access tokens'.
|github$$_$$pat$$_$$11APW.
|No

|docker$$_$$registries
|Docker registries accessible by the nodes. For EKS, no authentication is needed, as it is done automatically with the user's credentials.
|-
|Yes

|===

=== Networking

As mentioned above, the installer allows you to use network elements of the cloud provider that you have previously created (e.g. by a network security team), thus enabling architectures that best suit your needs.

Both the VPC and the subnets must be created in the cloud provider. The subnets can be private or public, but if they are public, they must have a _NAT gateway_ and an _Internet Gateway_ in the same VPC. If both types of subnets are specified, the worker nodes will be deployed in private subnets.

_Stratio KEOS_ will not manage the lifecycle of previously created objects.

=== Descriptor example

In this section, you will find two descriptor cases to demonstrate the capability of the cloud provisioner in the supported cloud providers.

==== EKS

In this example you can see the following particularities:

* Cluster on AWS with managed _control-plane_ (EKS).
* Kubernetes version 1.24.x (EKS does not take into account the patch version).
* Use of ECR as Docker registry (no credentials needed).
* Use of VPC and custom subnets ( previously created). This section is optional.
* API Server logs are enabled in EKS.
* Groups of workers nodes with multiple casuistry:
** Several instance types.
** With specific AMI (optional for this cloud provider). Note: the versions of the components in the image must be aligned with the Kubernetes version indicated.
** With SSH key.
** With K8s labels.
** With auto-scaling ranges.
** In a fixed zone.
** With customizations on disk.
** With spot-type instances.
** Distribution cases in AZs: balanced and unbalanced.

== Provider

_Cloud provisioner_ is a tool that facilitates the provisioning of the necessary elements in the specified cloud provider to create a Kubernetes cluster based on the specified <<cluster_descriptor, descriptor>>.

Currently, this binary includes the following options:

- `--descriptor`: indicates the path to the cluster descriptor.
- `--vault-password`: specifies the passphrase for credentials encryption.
- `--avoid-creation`: does not create the cluster worker, only the cluster local.
- `--keep-mgmt`: creates the cluster worker but leaves its management in the cluster local.
- `--retain`: keeps the cluster local even without management.

To create a cluster, a simple command is enough:

[source,bash]
-----
sudo ./cloud-provisioner create cluster --name stratio-pre --descriptor cluster-gcp.yaml
